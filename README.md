### Hi, I'm Harly :wave:
I'm a final year Data Science student at [**Huflit**](https://huflit.edu.vn). I was born and raised in peaceful countryside. Now I spend a lot of time researching Deep Learning. I wanna become an **AI Engineer** in the future

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in **Machine Learning** and **Deep learning**. Yah of course :upside_down_face:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Math**, **English** and **new things** 
- ðŸ“« Connect with me for work or study: **tranminhhai1506@gmail.com, [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harly-tranminhhai/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/harly1506/)**
- :sweat_smile: Fact: I love cats and hate English

I'm always open to ideas, conversations, and study together to develop myself. If you have problems with my repo, please leave a comment

:red_circle: I'm also a study streamer, I always self-motivate and push myself to develop. Also, I want someone to study with me. So if you find it interesting and want to learn with me then join me on youtube and my small family
